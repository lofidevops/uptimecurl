# uptimecurl

Basic monitoring tool designed for rapid deployment and simple results.

Scheduled monitoring, dashboards, alerts and other advanced features are
out of scope. Instead consider tools like crontab, Cockpit, Grafana or
Zabbix.

## Usage

```
Usage: uptimecurl [OPTIONS]

  Basic monitoring tool designed for rapid deployment and simple results.

  Define tests in the DEFINITION file and template in the TEMPLATE file.
  Report is generated at the OUTPUT path.

  Instead of command-line parameters you can use the environment variables
  UPTIMECURL_DEFINITION, UPTIMECURL_TEMPLATE and UPTIMECURL_OUTPUT. These
  can be defined in a .env file in the working directory.

Options:
  --definition FILE  List of test definitions (YAML).
  --template FILE    Template to generate report from test results (Mustache).
  --output FILE      Output path for report (typically HTML).
  --help             Show this message and exit.
```

### Sample definition

```
example_http:
    type: http_ok
    parameters:
      - http://en.wikipedia.org
example_port:
    type: port_ok
    parameters:
      - en.wikipedia.org
      - 443
```

### Sample template

See <https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html> for template language.

```
<tbody>
{{#data}}
  <tr>
    <td title="{{timestamp}}">
      {{name}}
    </td>
    <td title="{{parameters}}">
      {{type}}
    </td>
    <td title="{{message}}">
      {{success_code}}
    </td>
  </tr>
{{/data}}
</tbody>
```

### Sample report

Run `uptimecurl` without parameters to generate this sample report
in HTML (hover or view source on each cell for more detail):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Name
      </th>
      <th>
        Test
      </th>
      <th>
        Result
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td title="2020-09-03 16:28:42.416792">
          example_http
        </td>
        <td title="['http://en.wikipedia.org']">
          http_ok
        </td>
        <td title="http://en.wikipedia.org returned 301">
          ‚ùå
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td title="2020-09-03 16:28:42.449334">
          example_port
        </td>
        <td title="['en.wikipedia.org', 443]">
          port_ok
        </td>
        <td title="">
          üíö
        </td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Test types

#### http_ok

```
test_name:
    type: http_ok
    parameters:
      - https://example.com/path
```

Perform an HTTP request against any URL (parameter 0).

Return üíö if we get a `200 OK` response, ‚ùå otherwise.

Note that we expect strictly a `200 OK` reponse. Redirects and
other values will result in a failure. (See the sample report
for an example of a failure.)

#### port_ok

```
test_name:
    type: port_ok
    parameters:
      - domain.com
      - 1234
```

Attempt to connect to `domain:port` (parameter 0, parameter 1).

Return üíö if successful, ‚ùå otherwise.

Note that an open port does not guarantee that the underlying
application is working, just that the server is up and correctly
configured.

## Development environment

### Setup

```
git checkout https://gitlab.com/lofidevops/uptimecurl.git
cd uptimecurl
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
```

You can use a text editor, or any IDE that supports virtualenv / pipenv.

For pipenv details see <https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>

### Code quality

All cleanup and validation tasks should succeed without error or modification.

```
# coding conventions
black .
# unit tests
coverage run -m pytest
# coverage report (don't let it drop, aim for 90+)
coverage report > coverage.txt
# licensing metadata
reuse lint
# confirm no changes have occurred
git diff --exit-code
```

If all tasks pass, your changes are ready for submission. Otherwise you need
to fix, commit and validate again.

You can invoke these tasks in any CI/CD pipeline.

### Build

Build packages:

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

If everything works as expected you should end up with the files:

* `dist/<name>-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`
* `dist/<name>-<version>.tar.gz`

You can now optionally upload to PyPI:

```
twine upload dist/*
```

You can invoke these tasks in any CI/CD pipeline, but be aware of your threat model and the
security implications.
